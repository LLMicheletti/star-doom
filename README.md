### Implementations detail
ALthough based on a simple arcade game structure in pygame, this program uses advanced features to boost its performance.
* OOP for lighter management of groups with appropriate method for adding, updating and removing sprites more precisely and avoiding the creation of many instances;
* Numpy structures and operators for more efficient floating point computing, leading to more accurate position updating and smooth movements;
* Numba usage to run collisions check and updating methods in parallel.
